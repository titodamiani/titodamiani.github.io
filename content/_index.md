      text: |-        
        I am a senior research scientist in the _[Biochemistry of Plant Specialized Metabolites](https://pluskal.group.uochb.cz/en)_ group at [IOCB Prague](https://www.uochb.cz/en), led by Tomáš Pluskal. I joined the lab in November 2020, and was a self-funded postdoc (IOCB and MSCA.CZ Postdoctoral Fellowships) from 2021 through 2025.

        My background is in analytical chemistry, with extensive experience in mass spectrometry techniques. I also contribute develop popular computational metabolomics tools, such as the [mzmine](https://mzio.io/mzmine-news/) software and the [MassQL](https://mwang87.github.io/MassQueryLanguage_Documentation/) language.

        My current research focuses on the biosynthetic elucidation of specialised metabolism in non-model plants using omics techniques (metabolomics, transcriptomics).
